Advent of Code 2024

After Day 13 I decided to upload everything to GitHub. I am using Go which I want to learn with the intent to write Applications 
with it. Go is really nice.! I have literally never used it before, just did the [Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1).
After those 13 days I have to say that Go is one of my favorite languages! It feels like I have already used it for many years. 
It is really refreshing

I did not measure my time up until now. Most of them took me 30-120 Minutes. Most of the time I spent on bug fixing and googling some Go Libraries. I really had no issues besides: 
- **Day 6 Part 2:** I had issues defining a loop. Then I had some issues with brute forcing... It took way too long. I then narrowed down the 
search space â†’ Only checking the positions to place obstacles which the guard could hit
- **Day 11 Part 2:** Of course brute forcing does not work. After some thinking I got it. From the beginning I was thinking of some way to generalize it. In
the end I found a pretty neat solution myself without googling
- **Day 12 Part 2:** Took me some time to define Corners, though I quickly figured out that the number of edges in a Polygon is the number of corners. Part 1 was really quick. Coding just took some time
